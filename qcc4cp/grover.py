  # Note that op_zero multiplies the diagonal elements of the operator by -1,

  # the Deutsch Uf builder.

  # Number of Grover iterations

  # There are at least 2 ways to compute the required number of iterations.
  #
  # 1) Most text books, eg., page 157 of Kaye, Laflamme and Mosca, find
  #    that the highest probability of finding the right results occurs
  #    after pi/4 sqrt(n) rotations.
  #
  # 2) For grover specifically, with 1 solution the iteration count is indeed:
  #        int(math.pi / 4 * math.sqrt(n))
  #
  # 3) For grover with multiple solutions:
  #        int(math.pi / 4 * math.sqrt(n / solutions))
  #
  # 4) For amplitude amplification, it's the probability of good
  #    solutions, which is trivial with the Grover equal
  #    superposition here:
  #        int(math.sqrt(n / solutions))
  #
  iterations = int(math.pi / 4 * math.sqrt(2**nbits / solutions))
