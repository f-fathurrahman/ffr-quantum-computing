"""Example: Simple Variational Quantum Eigensolver."""


# VQE is a classic-quantum algorithm to find the Eigenvalues of
# a matrix H, which may be too large for classical methods (solving
# the characteristic equation).
#
# The algorithm has two parts:
#    1) Prepare a quantum state psi(theta)
#    2) Measure the expectation value of H in psi:
#        <H> = <psi(theta)|H|psi(theta)>
#
# This expectation value is always greater or equal to the lowest
# Eigenvalue lambda of H (variational theorem):
#        <H> >= lambda
#
# We need to chose real valued parameters 'theta' such that the expectation
# value is minimized.
#
# This example is based on the youtube video:
#    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E947xs9-Mso
# from Pranav Gokhale at ISCA 2018.
#
# Note: In the youtube video the larger matrix H contains a subterm
#       -1.04*sigma_z*I. So in order to minimize the expectation value
#       of the larger matrix, one has to maximize the expectation value
#       for sigma_z*I, which is what we do below. The algorithm works
#       just the same if we'd look for a minimum (-1.0) instead of 1.0
#
# Note: The vide also does _not_ actually multiply the ansatz with XxI,
# as that is the default measurement operator that requires no additional
# gates or mechanics to make anything work. In the book there is a big
# chapter on "Measuring in the Pauli Basis", which is important to
# understand to appreciate the code below.
